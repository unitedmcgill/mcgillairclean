                    <p>Uni-Stack ductwork is designed for use as prefabricated chimney, breeching, and exhaust systems. We can provide all the components needed to construct a complete system, including round duct, elbows, tees, supports, terminations, and connecting devices. Our standard designs meet the requirements of a wide range of boilers, incinerators, heating appliances, and industrial processes. Because corrosion can be a major problem in stacks, each of our standard products is designed to resist specific corrosive conditions. Components and materials should be chosen based on their ability to stand up to the corrosive properties of the flue gas being vented.</p>
                    <p>Our engineers can size your system and recommend one of our standard products or custom design a chimney system for you. By providing corrosion and thermal analyses for metals, refractories, and other chimney materials, we can determine how they will be affected by specific flue gas components. We can also make mid-flue and surface temperature calculations, seismic calculations, and structural analyses to help meet the requirements of your application.</p>

                  <h6>Single-Wall Stainless Steel Ductwork</h6>
                  <p>Uni-Stack-S single-wall, stainless steel ductwork is designed to resist atmospheric corrosion in exhaust systems that vent fume hoods and heating appliances and for boiler breeching systems. It can be used with fuels such as liquid propane gas, natural gas, #2, #4*, #5*, and #6* fuel oils, wood*, and coal* (*316 stainless steel should be specified when using these fuels for combustion). It is suitable for caustic air and fumes, vapors, and particle-containment systems. Uni-Stack-S ductwork can handle flue gas with a maximum temperature of 1,400°F for continuous firing and a maximum temperature of 1,800°F for intermittent firing.</p>

                  <h6>Double-Wall Ductwork</h6>
                  <p>Uni-Stack-1400 double-wall ductwork is designed for positive and negative pressure chimney and breeching systems that vent boilers, kilns, incinerators, grease ducts, and emergency generators. The double-wall design features a stainless steel inner liner and aluminized steel outer shell. It helps maintain a high flue gas temperature so that corrosive gases will not condense inside the stack. Insulation is available to lower the temperature of the duct's outer shell. This duct can be used with fuels such as liquid propane gas, natural gas, #2, #4*, #5*, and #6* fuel oils, wood*, and coal* (*316 stainless steel should be specified when using these fuels for combustion). It is suitable for caustic air and fumes, grease vapors, and particle-containment systems. Uni-Stack-1400 ductwork can handle flue gas with a maximum temperature range of 1,000°F to 1,400°F for continuous firing and a maximum temperature range of 1,400°F to 1,800°F (2,000°F in grease duct applications) for intermittent firing.</p>

                  <p>In addition to supplying our standard products, we can engineer a chimney for your application. Our engineering services include sizing, structural analysis, thermal analysis, and corrosion analysis. We can recommend a stack lining for specific thermal and corrosion conditions. Typical linings are cast refractory, gunned refractory, foamed borosilicate block, fiberglass-reinforced polymer, and organic coatings.</p>
                  <p>We can also design a single stack that contains multiple chimney systems constructed of steel or other materials. For existing chimneys, we can perform field inspections and recommend repairs. Large projects can be field fabricated and installed at the jobsite.</p>
